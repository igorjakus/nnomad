### Slide 4: Core Data Structure
- **Expression Tree (expr):**
  ```ocaml
  type expr =
    | Float of float
    | Var of string
    | Add of expr * expr
    | Sub of expr * expr
    | Mult of expr * expr
    | Div of expr * expr
    | Pow of expr * expr
    | Exp of expr
    | Log of expr
    | Sin of expr
    | Cos of expr
  ```
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple, recursive structure.
  - Extensible for new operations.

---

### Slide 5: Expression Simplification
- **Why Simplify?**
  - Reduce computational complexity.
  - Improve readability of symbolic expressions.
- **Examples:**
  - `x + 0 → x`
  - `log(exp(x)) → x`
  - `x − (-y) → x + y`
- **Key Algorithm:**
  - Apply recursive rules until no further simplifications are possible.

---

### Slide 6: Derivatives
- **Symbolic Differentiation:**
  ```ocaml
  let rec derivative expr var = match expr with
    | Float _ -> Float 0.
    | Var x when x = var -> Float 1.
    | Add (f, g) -> derivative f var +: derivative g var
    | Mult (f, g) -> (derivative f var *: g) +: (f *: derivative g var)
    | ...
  ```
- **nth Derivative:**
  - Repeated application of the `derivative` function.

---

### Slide 7: Gradient and Gradient Descent
- **Gradient:**
  - Partial derivatives for all variables in an expression.
  ```ocaml
  let gradient expr =
    List.map (fun var -> (var, derivative expr var)) variables
  ```
- **Gradient Descent:**
  - Update variables to minimize a given expression.
  ```ocaml
  let gradient_descent expr env lr iterations = ...
  ```
- **Applications:**
  - Optimizing loss functions in machine learning.

---

### Slide 8: Code Design Highlights
- **Functional Programming Concepts:**
  - Recursion for expression evaluation and simplification.
  - Pattern matching for clarity and robustness.
- **Operator Overloading:**
  - Intuitive syntax for mathematical expressions.
  ```ocaml
  let (+:) a b = Add (a, b)
  let (/:) a b = Div (a, b)
  ```
- **Modularity:**
  - Separate modules for environment handling and differentiation.

---

### Slide 9: Testing and Validation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simplification rules.
  - Evaluation with known environments.
  - Gradient descent convergence.
- **Examples:**
  ```ocaml
  assert (simplify (Log (Exp (Var "x"))) = Var "x");
  assert (eval env (Var "x" +: Float 0.) = 2.0);
  ```
- **Future Improvements:**
  - More test cases.
  - Optimize simplification logic.
